          <P>
            We present a numerical method for the solution of the
            Navier-Stokes equations in three dimensions that handles
            interfacial discontinuities due to singular forces and
            discontinuous fluid properties such as viscosity and
            density.  We show that this also allows for the enforcement
            of normal stress and velocity boundary conditions on
            irregular domains. The method provides treatment of fluid
            inertia as well as a new discretization of jump and boundary
            conditions that accurately resolves null modes in both two
            and three dimensions. We discretize the equations using an
            embedded approach on a uniform MAC grid to yield discretely
            divergence-free velocities that are second order
            accurate. We maintain our interface using the level set
            method or, when more appropriate, the particle level set
            method. We show how to implement Dirichlet (known velocity),
            Neumann (known normal stress), and slip velocity boundary
            conditions as special cases of our interface
            representation. The method leads to a discrete, symmetric
            KKT system for velocities, pressures, and Lagrange
            multipliers. We also present a novel simplification to the
            standard combination of the second order semi-Lagrangian and
            BDF schemes for discretizing the inertial terms. Numerical
            results indicate second order spatial accuracy for the
            velocities (L-inf and L2) and first order for the pressure (in
            L-inf, second order in L2). Our temporal discretization is
            also second order accurate.
